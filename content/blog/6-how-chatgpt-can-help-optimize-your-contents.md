## How ChatGPT can help optimize your contents
#### Enhance your digital marketing efforts with ChatGPT. Learn how to extract entities, analyze SERP results, and craft topically relevant contents.

When strategically utilized, ChatGPT can surpass manual human effort in output quality. 

No, the tools won’t write better content.

Instead, I believe a writer armed with this technology can craft optimized content that’s better aligned with Google’s ranking criteria.

By exploring various methods of content scoring and entity extraction, I aim to guide you toward maximizing the tools’ benefits.

“Beyond keywords: How entities impact modern SEO strategies” discussed how and why to include relevant entities across your website (i.e., topical map). 

This article will focus on why and how to use entities to create better-ranking SEO content. 
## Optimizing new content for entities
Google identifies entities and their predicates on a web page. It also compares them across potentially relevant pages. 

In essence, it’s like a matchmaker, trying to find the best match between a user’s search query and the content available on the web. 

Given that Google’s algorithm is optimized for high-quality results, start your optimization process by examining the top 10 Google results. 

This will give you insights into the attributes that Google favors for a given search term. 

At our agency, we apply a framework to identify potential enhancements that can make our articles 10-20% better, which I’ll share below.

A framework that prioritizes the right aspects can illustrate the difference between your content and the highest-ranking material. 

When creating content, we follow this framework and fulfill these priority items. 

We set ourselves up for immediate success if we meet all these criteria.
## OpenAI 
ChatGPT and OpenAI are truly game-changers in SEO. 

To unlock its full potential, it needs a well-informed SEO expert to steer it along the right path and a meticulously constructed entity map to guide it on relevant topics to write about.

Consider a scenario: 

You might have realized you can head to ChatGPT and ask it to write an article about almost any subject, and it will readily comply. 

However, the question is, will the resulting article be optimized to rank for a keyword?

We must draw a clear distinction between general content and search-optimized content. 

When AI is left to its own devices to write your content, it tends to generate an article that appeals to a regular reader. 

However, content optimized for SEO dances to a different tune. 

Google tends to favor content that’s scannable, includes definitions and necessary background knowledge, and fundamentally offers plenty of hooks for readers to find answers to their search queries.

ChatGPT, being powered by transformer architecture, tends to produce content based on observed frequency and patterns in the data it was trained on. A small fraction of this data consists of top-ranking Google articles. 

In contrast, as time passes, Google adapts its search results to their effectiveness for a user – essentially survival of the fittest content pieces. 

The entities found in these enduring articles are vital to emulate as foundational content, which tends to diverge significantly from what ChatGPT produces right out of the box.

The key takeaway is that there’s a difference between content that’s a winner from a readability standpoint and content that’s a winner in a Google environment. In the world of web content, utility trumps all. 
## Taking it one step further
The methods we’ve discussed are a starting point, allowing you to create content that covers a broader range of entities and their predicates than any of your competitors. 

By following this approach, you’re writing content that mirrors the characteristics of pages that Google already favors. 

But remember, this is just a jumping-off point. These competing pages have likely been around for some time and may have accrued more back-links and user metrics. 

If your goal is to outperform them, you’ll need to make your content stand out even more.

As the web becomes increasingly saturated with AI-generated content, it’s reasonable to speculate that Google might start favoring websites it trusts to establish new entity relationships. This will likely shift how content is evaluated, emphasizing original thought and innovation more. 

As a writer, this means going beyond merely incorporating the subjects covered by the top 10 results. Instead, ask yourself: what unique perspective can you offer missing from the current top 10?

It’s not just about the tools. It’s about us, the strategists, the thinkers, the creators. 

It’s about how we wield these tools and how we balance the computational prowess of software with the creative spark of the human mind. 

Just like in the world of chess, it’s the combination of machine precision and human ingenuity that truly makes a difference. 

So, let’s embrace this new era of SEO, where we’re creating content and crafting experiences that resonate with our audience and stand out in the vast digital landscape.
