First, you should know that people form relationships with brands, not businesses. A brand encompasses the products/services of a company and molds how people perceive the company. Brand building is a continuous and essential step for every business that wants to grow. A good brand image humanizes your business and informs your target audience on how they can benefit from your products/services. Your branding determines how people perceive your brand, increasing brand loyalty and value.

### Brand Purpose
What is your brand’s purpose, how is it different from the others, and how will it help your audience? It would help if you were well versed in answering all these questions before starting your business. Your brand purpose is the driving force behind everything you do. It impacts how you are viewed by customers, employees, and the marketplace. It relates to your service or product and speaks to your employees, customers, stakeholders, communities, and more.

### Target Audience
The target audience is the specific group of people you are trying to reach. When choosing your target audience, it’s important not to target everyone. Even though you might sell your product or service to a wide variety of people, you want to focus on the core group most likely to need or want what you’re selling. It is essential to identify this audience and do well demographical and financial research on their purchasing behavior that can help you understand things about your product or services.

### Write a Tagline
A tagline communicates a brand or business aspect in a punchy sentence or soundbite. Slogans help a company stand out from the competition; they’re usually expressed with a logo. The tagline is a powerful communication message which becomes a public earworm and gets stuck in their brain. It is crafted to have a long-lasting effect in just one encounter. It communicates the brand personality to the consumer in easy words and, if prepared correctly, sounds the overall benefit of what is offered to them.

### Identity design
The next step is to design your brand’s identity based on your research and strategy. Identity design is kind of like a preview of your brand. Each part of your design is a clue that tells the viewer what they can expect. Your aesthetic can be traditional, modern, or a little more; every brand is different. All your design elements work together to show exactly what your brand is about.

### Market yourself
When you have an image ready for yourself, communicate with your tribe. Tell your stories and help them to connect with you and show up again and again with something meaningful and effective. Your unique brand associations allow you to differentiate your brand from the competition. Ideally, you’ll want to foster positive brand associations that align well with your company’s values and image.
