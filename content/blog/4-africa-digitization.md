## How Much is Africa Digitized?
Africa, a continent known largely for its Arts, Rich Tradition, Agriculture, as well as Natural resources among many more, have been at the top of the radar, at least for its vast cultural history. Hence, most people see Africa as an underdeveloped continent, especially in areas such as technology. It is rather important to note that countries like Egypt, have developed massively in digitization and have taken advantage of rapid increases in internet penetration to make concrete improvements in the lives of citizens.
African continent registers close to 20% of the world’s population and most importantly, The continent holds a huge proportion of the world’s natural resources, both renewable, and non-renewable which could be used as sway for investors.

Africa is home to some 30 percent of the world’s mineral reserves, eight percent of the world’s natural Gas, and 12 percent of the world’s oil reserves with all of these resources, Africa has not been able to harness the power of what they have as leverage to get what they want but in recent times, countries like Egypt have come to understand that the infusion of tech into their economy will bring about massive growth and development and this is evident in their government and policies.

Africa is gradually developing to be one of the most technologically advanced continents in the world, infusing tech into other factors that contribute to their growth Economically such as Ed-tech, Agro-Tech, and so on has brought ease to the running of the systems and policies in governance.
