      <em>In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics —

      <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. 
        This information does not reveal your specific identity {'(like your name or contact information)'} 
        but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, 
        operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, 
        information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. 
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services,

        <p>•	Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device&apos;s location, 
          which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of 
          the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation 
          data that tells us your current location {'(based on your IP address)'}. You can opt out of allowing us to collect 
          this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device.

      <em>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account,

      <br /><br />
      <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details 
        {'(like your Facebook or Twitter logins)'}. Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information 
        about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the 
        social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, 
        as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform. </p><br />
      <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or

        No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time 
        in which users have an account with us.</p><br />
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, 
        we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible 
        {'(for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives)'}, 
        then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it 
        from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <br /><br />

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
      <br />
      <em>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em>
      <br /><br />
      <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed 
        to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and 
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information 
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that 
        hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security 
        and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to 
        protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. 
        You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

        you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and

        collected from children under age 18, please contact us at admin@awajai.com.</p>
        <br /><br />

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
      <br />
      <em>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em>
      <br /><br />
      <p> <span className='font-bold'>Withdrawing your consent:{' '}</span>If we are relying on your consent to 
      process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, 
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time 
      by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section {' '}  
      <Link href="#" className='underline text-blue-700'>&quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot;</Link> below.</p> <br />

        when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance 
        on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p><br />

      <h4 className='text-xl font-bold'>Account Information</h4><br />
      <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or

      <div className='ml-8'>
        <p>•	Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>

      <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and 
        information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files 
        to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
         terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p><br />
      <p> <span className='font-bold'>Cookies and similar technologies: {' '}</span>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. 
      If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.

      <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at admin@awajai.com.</p>
      <br /><br />

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track {'("DNT")'} 
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online 
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing 
        and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT 
        browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. 
        If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, 
        we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <br /><br />

      <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>
      <br />
      <em>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em>
      <br /><br />
      <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an 
        updated &quot;Revised&quot; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. 
        If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently 
        posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you 
        to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
